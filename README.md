### This is a repository for my SAS and Stata commands used in the study
**Data source**: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2004-2013

**Data management**: SAS was used to combine 10 years of data. 
- Rename varibles: since some variables contain year indicator in their name (e.g. UNINS13: uninsured variable in 2013) 
- Combine data

**Data cleaning and data analysis**: Stata was used to clean the data and to perform difference-in-differneces analysis
